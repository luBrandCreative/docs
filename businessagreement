Your Available Balance is the amount of money you have in your Account at any given time that is available for you to use. Your ledger balance is the balance in your Account at the beginning of the day after we have posted all transactions to your Account from the day before. We use your Available Balance to authorize your transactions throughout the day and determine whether you have sufficient funds to pay your transactions. Here are some additional terms that are helpful to understand:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_mbvf5c7i5eir-0 start"><li class="c1 c40 li-bullet-1"><span class="c3">Credit and debit &ndash; A credit increases your balance and a debit decreases your balance.<br></span></li><li class="c1 c40 li-bullet-1"><span class="c3">Post or posted &ndash; Transactions that are paid from or deposited to your Account. Posted transactions will either increase or decrease both your Available Balance and your ledger balance.<br></span></li><li class="c1 c40 li-bullet-1"><span class="c3">Pending &ndash; Transactions that we receive notice of and are scheduled to post to or be debited from your Account. Pending debit transactions affect your Available Balance, but not your ledger balance. &nbsp;Pending deposit transactions do not affect your Available Balance or your ledger balance.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c24"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c1 c4 c22" id="h.rhrrl2rj142w"><span class="c17">3.10.2 </span><span class="c14">Posting Order </span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We receive the transactions throughout the day and post them to your Account as they are received and in the order that they are received. Note that for debit card transactions, we consider the transaction received when we settle the transaction with the merchant, which may occur several days after you authorize the transaction. See below for additional information concerning how debit card transactions are processed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">We may change the order in which we post transactions to your Account upon reasonable prior notice to you and in compliance with applicable law. It is therefore important for you to keep track of the deposits you make and the transactions you authorize to make sure there are sufficient funds in your Account to cover all transactions and any applicable fees.</span></p><h3 class="c1 c4 c22" id="h.8a0hxhydvtt1"><span class="c17">3.10.3 </span><span class="c14">Determining Your Ledger Balance and Available Balance</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Your Account&rsquo;s ledger balance is the current balance of cleared and settled funds in your Account at the beginning of each business day. Your Account&rsquo;s Available Balance is the ledger balance reduced by debits we receive throughout the day and increased by credits we make available to you. Specifically, to determine your Available Balance, we start with your ledger balance at the beginning of the business day, add any pending credits or deposits that we make available to you, and subtract any card authorizations and pending debits. All transactions are debited or credited from your Available Balance in the order received. </span></p><h3 class="c1 c41" id="h.xkcikyg6p1kk"><span class="c12">Your balance is accessible through the Online Banking Services or as otherwise indicated herein. Keep in mind that your Available Balance may not reflect every transaction you have initiated or previously authorized. For example, your Available Balance will not include transactions you have authorized that we have not received.</span><span class="c17">&nbsp;</span></h3><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.v578u66lofgn"><span class="c11">3.11 </span><span class="c0">Statements</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Statements will periodically be provided to you through the Online Banking Services as long as your Account is not inactive.

If there were no transactions on your Account, we will provide you with statements on a quarterly basis. You will not receive paper statements.</span></p><p class="c1 c24"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.48lrwjaob2m"><span class="c11">3.12 </span><span class="c0">Errors On Your Account and Limitations of Liability</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c12">The Account is a commercial Account. </span><a id="kix.l9lburikse9g"></a><span class="c3">You will not have the benefit of any consumer law limiting liability with respect to the unauthorized use of the Account. This means your liability for unauthorized use of your Account could be greater than the liability in a consumer transaction. You agree to undertake the additional risk and greater measure of liability associated with the use of business Accounts as described in this Agreement, your Business VISA Debit Cardholder Agreement (if applicable), and any other applicable agreements. You are liable for transactions you do not authorize if we can prove that we processed the transaction in good faith and in compliance with commercially reasonable security procedures to which we both agreed, unless otherwise required by law.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">In addition, and without limiting any other term of this Agreement or any other agreement between us, you are fully liable for all transactions involving your Account if: (a) you give Account information to another person, including any person who you expressly or implicitly authorize to use the Account, and that person exceeds the authority granted or that person continues to conduct transactions after you have terminated authority, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement; (b) you fail to safeguard your Account information as required by this Agreement or you violate any other term of this Agreement; (c) the transaction is conducted by a </span><a id="kix.kd70besy9lqm"></a><span class="c3">person who has an ownership interest in your company or entity, by an Authorized User, or a person authorized by any of the foregoing or by any other person who has an interest in the Account, who has authority to conduct transactions on the Account, or who is an employee of yours; or (d) our investigation reveals that the facts do not reasonably support a claim of unauthorized use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You should carefully review your statements and promptly report to us any errors or unauthorized activity by email at the address indicated in Section 1.1 above. &nbsp;You MUST report errors and unauthorized activity within thirty (30) days after we make the statement available to you. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or required by law, if you do not provide us with timely notice of an error or unauthorized activity, we will deem our records concerning your Account and all cards to be correct and we will not be liable to you for any Loss you suffer relating to the error or unauthorized activity. You further agree that we may debit or credit your Account at any time and without notice to you to correct an error or address unauthorized activity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Please refer to the relevant section below for additional information concerning errors and unauthorized transactions involving electronic fund transfers and related limitations of liability. </span></p><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.1uclqzmr544m"><span class="c11">3.13 </span><span class="c0">Overdrafts, Nonsufficient Funds and Negative Balances</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">An overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your Account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. We do not offer overdraft services or charge fees for overdrafts or non-sufficient funds. &nbsp;We typically will return or decline to process a transaction (including, where applicable, ATM and debit card transactions) if it exceeds your Available Balance. &nbsp;However, it is still possible for you to overdraft your Account, such as when you write checks (since there is a delay between when you write the check and when we receive it for processing), when we settle authorized debit card transactions, as discussed in Section 3.10.4, or if a deposit you make is returned. &nbsp;If your Account includes the ability to write checks, we may pay a check drawn on your Account even if you do not have sufficient funds in your Account. Generally, we base this decision on criteria such as your Account history, the deposits you make, and the amount of the check, but we reserve the right to change the criteria that we use to make this determination at any time. We pay checks that will overdraw your Account at our sole discretion. If we pay a check that overdraws your Account on one or more occasions, we are not obligated to continue paying checks that will overdraw your Account in the future. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You must make a deposit immediately to cover any negative balance, including a negative balance resulting from an overdraft. If your Account has a negative balance for sixty (60) calendar days or more, we may close your Account. &nbsp;We reserve the right to close your Account at an earlier date, as permitted by law.</span></p><p class="c1 c24"><span class="c3"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.588qry4j8082"><span class="c11">3.14 </span><span class="c0">Closing Your Account and Account Suspensions</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You can close your Account at any time and for any reason by contacting us as set forth in Section 1.1. We reserve the right to refuse your request if you have a negative balance on your Account. We recommend that you transfer or withdraw any funds you may have in the Account prior to submitting a request to close the Account to avoid delays in receiving your funds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We may also suspend or close your Account, or suspend or disable any service or feature of your Account, at our discretion with or without notice. This includes if we believe you are using your Account for fraudulent or illegal purposes; in violation of law or regulation, this Agreement, or any other agreement you may have with us or our third-party service providers; if multiple transactions are returned on your Account; or if you otherwise present undue risk to us or our third-party service providers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Accounts with a zero balance will continue to be charged applicable fees until you request to close your Account. We may close an Account with a zero balance on the fee period ending date or at month end without prior notification to you. Once an Account is closed (either by you or us), no fees will be assessed on the Account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We may also close your Account if you have not made any deposits or withdrawals from your Account in over twelve (12) months. In addition, canceling your enrollment in the Online Banking Services with Program Partner will result in our closure of the Account. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If your Account is closed with a balance greater than $1.00, we will return any funds you may have in the Account to you by ACH transfer to another bank account or by paper check sent to the most recent address you have provided to us. We reserve the right not to return the funds to you if the balance in your Account is $1.00 or less. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">We are not responsible to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of the closure or suspension of your Account. The closure of your Account or termination of this Agreement does not impact any right or obligation that arose prior to closure or termination, or any right or obligation that, by its nature, should survive termination (including all indemnifications obligation by you, our limitations of liability, and all terms governing arbitration).</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.6zmessowf9u"><span class="c11">3.15 </span><span class="c0">Dormancy, Inactivity and Unclaimed Property</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">State law and our policy govern when your Account is considered dormant. Your Account is usually considered dormant if you have not accessed your Account, communicated to us about your Account or otherwise shown an interest in your Account within the period of time specified under applicable law. Each state has varying laws as to when an account becomes dormant, and we may be required to send the balance in your Account if it becomes dormant to the state of your last known address. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you if required by applicable law before transferring the remaining balance of your Account to the applicable state. After we surrender the funds to the state, you must apply to the appropriate state agency to reclaim your funds. You can avoid the surrender of your funds by simply conducting transactions, contacting us about your Account as set forth in Section 1.1, or replying to any abandoned property notices we may provide to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We may also place your Account in an inactive status if you have not had any transaction for at least six (6) months.

To the extent permitted by law, the parties waive any provision of law which prohibits or renders unenforceable any provisions of this Agreement, and to the extent that such waiver is not permitted by law, you and we agree that such provision will be interpreted as modified to the minimum extent necessary to render the provisions enforceable.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c11">7.10 </span><a id="id.1pxezwc"></a><span class="c0">Governing Law, Forum, and Time Limits </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">All actions relating to your Account and this Agreement will be governed by the laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Nebraska where your Account will be opened, irrespective of conflict of law principles. You agree that any dispute arising under this Agreement or relating in any way to your relationship with us that is not arbitrated will be resolved in a federal or state court located in Nebraska and that you will be subject to such court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except where prohibited by law, you agree that you must file any lawsuit or arbitration against us within two (2) years after the claim arises unless federal or Nebraska law, or another agreement you have with us, provides for a shorter time.

As used in this Arbitration Provision, &ldquo;Claim&rdquo; will include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and us on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from this Agreement, including the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise. Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">You have the right to opt-out of this arbitration clause and it will not affect any other terms and conditions of this Agreement or your relationship with us. TO OPT OUT, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING OF YOUR INTENT TO DO SO WITHIN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER OPENING YOUR ACCOUNT. Your opt-out notice can be a letter that is signed by you that states &ldquo;I elect to opt out of the arbitration clause in my Business Deposit Account Agreement for Account #&rdquo; or any words to that effect. Send the notice as set forth in Section 1.1. An election to opt out applies only to the account or accounts identified in your opt-out notice or, if no specific accounts are identified in your notice, then to any account(s) that became subject to the arbitration clause within the sixty (60)-day period before we received your notice. The arbitration clause will apply to any claims between us relating to any account(s) for which we do not receive an opt-out notice as described in this section.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.2 Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act; Arbitrator&rsquo;s Powers </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the &ldquo;FAA&rdquo;). The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator will take steps to reasonably protect confidential information. In any arbitration arising out of or related to this Agreement, the arbitrator will apply the limitation of liability set forth above and, for the avoidance of doubt, is not empowered to award (a) punitive or exemplary Losses, except where permitted by statute, or (b) incidental, indirect or consequential Losses, or Losses for lost profits. The parties waive any right to recover all such Losses.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.3 Informal Dispute Resolution </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If a Claim arises, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so, to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. You agree that before filing any claim in arbitration, you will first submit your Claim to us by email at the address specified above and provide us with the opportunity to resolve your concern prior to initiating arbitration.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.4 Arbitration Procedures </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c12">The party initiating arbitration will do so with the Judicial Alternatives and Mediation Services (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;). The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator according to, and the location of the arbitration will be determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing law. If you have any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their web site at: </span><span class="c12 c23"><a class="c36" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jamsadr.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1703190393674354&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ByHyxuRwH_Y23VzPzo-Oo">www.jamsadr.com</a></span><span class="c3">. In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision will control, subject to countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.5 Arbitration Fees </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">If we initiate arbitration, we will pay all the administrator&#39;s filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you initiate arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) will be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the administrator&#39;s rules. We will pay the administrator&#39;s hearing fees for one (1) full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one (1) day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator&#39;s rules or applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys&#39; fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights will apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.6 Appeals </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Within thirty (30) days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within thirty (30) days after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal will be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator&#39;s rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.7 No Class Actions </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration will determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator will have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this section, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, will be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this section will be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.8 Survival and Severability of Arbitration Provision </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination of this Agreement. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than the subsection titled &ldquo;No Class Actions&rdquo; is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision will nevertheless remain valid and in force. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision&rsquo;s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term, then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be brought in court. If an arbitration is brought on a class, representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in the previous subsection are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of that subsection as unenforceable, then no arbitration will be had. In no event will any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.9 Judicial Forum for Claims </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that this Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim, you and we agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Nebraska. Both you and we consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. All parties agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">8.10 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY BUT ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING THAT RIGHT BY AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ARBITRATION PROVISION.</span></p><h1 class="c1 c41"><span class="c31">9</span><span class="c32">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretation</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the following rules apply: (a) the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular; (b) all references to the masculine gender include the feminine gender (and vice versa); (c) &ldquo;include&rdquo;, &ldquo;includes&rdquo; and &ldquo;including&rdquo; are not limiting; (d) unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise provided herein, references to a particular agreement, instrument, document, law or regulation also refer to and include all renewals, extensions, modifications, amendments and restatements of such agreement, instrument, document, law or regulation; (e) a reference in this Agreement to a Section or Schedule is to the Section of or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise expressly provided; (f) a reference to a Section in this Agreement, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, refers to all sub-parts or sub-components of any said Article or Section; (g) words such as &ldquo;hereunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereto,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereof,&rdquo; and &ldquo;herein,&rdquo; and other words of like import, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, refers to the whole of this Agreement and not to any particular Section, subsection or clause hereof; (h) where the Agreement states that a Party &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; &ldquo;will,&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo; perform in some manner or otherwise act or omit to act, it means that the Party is legally obligated to do so in accordance with the Agreement; &nbsp;and (i) references to any statute includes any amendments thereto and its implementing regulations.</span></p><h1 class="c1 c41"><span class="c31">10</span><span class="c32">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</span></h1><a id="id.2p2csry"></a><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Except with respect to Indemnified Parties and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not be construed to give any third party any interest or rights (including any third-party beneficiary rights) with respect to or in connection with any agreement or provision contained herein or contemplated hereby. &nbsp;Use of the Account is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions. Bank does not waive its rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at any time. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the court or other tribunal making such determination is authorized and instructed to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible so that the transactions and agreements contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. The headings in this Agreement are only for convenience and do not in any way limit or define your or our rights or obligations under this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and other agreements or disclosures you may receive from us with respect to the Account or your debit card, contain the entire statement of the terms and conditions, which apply to the subject matter hereof. If any term or condition of this Agreement should be invalidated or unenforceable for any reason, all other terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect. </span></p><p class="c2 c24"><span class="c3"></span></p><div><p class="c24 c53"><span class="c37"></span></p><p class="c2 c24"><span class="c37"></span></p><p class="c1 c24"><span class="c37"></span></p></div></body></html>
